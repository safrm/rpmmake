description: fast script to create rpm package inside the git repo without being root 

content: 
 rpmmake  ................ main linux bash script
 rpmmake-changelog ....... generates rpm changelog (<my-project>.changes file) from git log
 rpmmake-debchangelog .... generates debian changelog (debian/changelog file) from git log
 install.sh .............. executes installation to /urs/bin directory

usage1:
<my-project>$ rpmmake  ................... builds rpms from <my-project>/<my-project>.spec in <my-project>/rpm rootdir
								           requires <my-project>/<my-project>.spec and tags as x.y.z
usage2:
rpmmake  /<my-path>/<my-project> ......... builds rpms from /<my-path>/<my-project>/<my-project>.spec in /<my-path>/<my-project>/rpm rootdir

usage3: 
<some-other-name>$ rpmmake -b <my-project> ...... project name is taken from argument <my-project> instead of directory name
                                                  this is important for Hudson/Jenkins slaves because they are using own sub-directorical structure

usage4: generate changelogs
